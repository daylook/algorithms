/*
Greedy Algorithm : Solution is constructed through a sequence of steps. At each step, choice is made
which is locally optimal. Greedy algorithms are generally used to solve optimization problems. We
always take the next data to be processed depending upon the dataset which we have already processed
and then choose the next optimum data to be processed. Greedy algorithms does not always give optimum
solution. For example:
· Minimal spanning tree: Prim’s algorithm, Kruskal’s algorithm
· Dijkstra’s algorithm for single-source shortest path problem
· Greedy algorithm for the Knapsack problem
· The coin exchange problem
· Huffman trees for optimal encoding
