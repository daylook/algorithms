Note: This is an under development personal project for future educational purposes and shouldn't be used for any production.

Most of algorthim questions are from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ and etc. Algorithms are mainy grouped as:

1. Brute Force  
2. Greedy Algorithms
3. Divide-and-Conquer
4. Dynamic Programming
5. Reduction / Transform-and-Conquer
6. Backtracking 
7. Branch-and-Bound
8. Geometric
9. Mathematical
10. Randomized
